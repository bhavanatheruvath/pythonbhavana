One little bird, perched on a tree,
Two fluffy clouds, floating so free. 
Three buzzing bees, around the flowers, 
Four bright stars, in the evening hours.
Five shiny shells, on the sandy shore, 
Six happy kids, running to explore. 
Seven rainbow colors, in the sky so bright, 
Eight tiny fireflies, glowing in the night.
Nine playful kittens, chasing a hen, 
Ten joyful moments, again and again.
